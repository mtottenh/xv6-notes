Meeting 3.

Agenda
======

- Lab 1.
    - Did we get a chance to peek at it?
    - Do we need more time?
    - Things covered:
        - Switching from real mode (16 bit) to protected mode (32 bit)
        - x86 boot protocol
        - ELF binary format (briefly)
            - How to load an elf binary
        - x86 assembly refresher
        - Using gdb to debug low level code
        - How a stack is setup.

Chaper 3. Virtual Memory

Page Tables galor!

 * When paging is enabled all x86 instructions use virtual addresses.
 * The cells in DRAM are indexed by physical adresses
 * x86 has some hardware to assist us in the translation of virtual addresses
   to physcial addresses (the MMU)
        * Broadly, we provide the hardware with the adress of a mapping table
          and it will translate for us on every acess
 * The MMU also allows for setting attributes on a per page basis.

 * The basic idea is as follows (for a 32 bit adressing scheme):
        * each page is 4K, there are 1,048,576 entries in the page table. (1,048,576 * 4096 / 1024 /1024 / 1024 = 4GB)
          So all we need is a simple linear array from 0 .. 1,048,576 where each entry will represent a page.
        * As a page is 4096 bytes, the lower 12 bits (2^12 = 4096) of the virtual address can
          be copied unchanged, (they wont affect the page we reside in), thus
          the top 20 bits will act as the index into the page table, and we can
          use the lower 12 bits in the value at that index to store some metadata about
          the page

                                                            |
       +----------------+                                   |
       |   PHADDR       |                                   |

       +----------------+                       |
       |                |                       |
       |                |                       |
       |                |                       +
       |                |               top address bits
       +----------------+               act as an index
       |                |                into the table
       +----------------+


 * In practice xv6 actually uses a two dimensional page table, (1 PDE of 1024 entries, each pointing to a page table with 1024 entries).
        * From an engineering perspective, it allows us to more efficently hold
          the structures in a cache, but in essence the idea is the same



Limitations of xv6
==================
* It assumes at least 240MB of physical ram available.
* It won't use any extra
* the stack is fixed at one page (can't increase)
* No demand paging from disk (OOM is really OOM, no swapping)
* No CoW
* No Shared memory for IPC

From here we can have a choice.
* We can keep with the course and see where it leads us.
* We can decide instead to focus purely on xv6 and leave out JOS for now
* We can think up some insteresting extensions to xv6
    * Available RAM detection
    * Allowing the stack to grow beyond one page if required.
