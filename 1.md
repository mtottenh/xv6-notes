#Meeting 1


Agenda

Chapter 0 of the xv6 book.

- How did we find it?
    - Questions
- Brief summary
    - Looking at xv6 from an application programmers prospective.
    - What is the UAPI/Interface that application programmers have to work with.

- Pipes and file descriptors
- A look at sh.c
    - Note the homework version is different from the one in the xv6 source code.
    - I recomend not looking at the one in the xv6 source code if you attempt the homework (no cheating :))
    - We can get a lot done with very little code:
        * main() is only 30 lines
            - Get a command (limited to 100chars) 
                - If it is a built-in (currently only 'cd')
                - Fork and wait for child to complete the command
                    - child parses & execs the command.
        * ulib.c is tiny.
- A look at ulib.c
    - memset/memcpy etc.
    - string functions.
    - very small.
- Ways to better organize these meetings? (Future topics of discussion).
